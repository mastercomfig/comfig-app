**Changes**

* Fixed more sniper scope hiding exploits
* Health icon is now always enabled in the target ID, even if floating health is enabled.
  * Can be disabled with the ConVar `tf_hud_target_id_disable_health_icon 1`
* Added ConVar setting `tf_hud_target_id_disable_floating_health 2`, which will keep floating health icons enabled for applicable MvM bots
* Fixed Medi-Gun effects not rendering properly while spectating in first person
* Fixed weapons not rendering properly while spectating in first person
* Added `tf_force_team_vision` ConVar for spectators to view team vision from the perspective of RED (`2`) or BLU (`3`) during competitive matches
* Fixed various effects showing up through fog of war (team vision during spectating)
* Made 32 players the default. Upcoming changes will adjust default maximum team size to 24, but will allow additional players to join spectators
* Changed the Dragon's Fury to fire from the center, so that the hitbox accuracy check works more intuitively for the user

**Fixes**

* Fixed application icon not loading properly since yesterday's update
* Fixed various match HUD elements not initializing properly, like the KOTH timer
