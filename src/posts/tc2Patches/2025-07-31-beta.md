**Changes**

* Testing spread reworks:
  * Accuracy recovery time is now set to be 66% slower than firing rate, rather than being a fixed 1.25 seconds. Accuracy recovery time cannot be higher than the old fixed value, though.
    * Effectively, this means you can exchange lower ideal DPS for better accuracy / guaranteed DPS by tap firing guns like the Pistol and Revolver.
  * The Ambassador is now always accurate upon firing (still has the same 1 second cooldown for headshots)
  * Miniguns are now guaranteed to fire at least one pellet with perfect accuracy
  * Spread is now based upon a real Gaussian distribution (circular). This will improve evenness of pellet distribution.
