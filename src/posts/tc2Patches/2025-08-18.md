**Changes**

* Fixed Revenge Crits and other self-boosted crits being consumed while crit boosted from another source
* Fixed pings not going through grates and windows
* Fixed pings lingering on enemy Spies who disguised or cloaked after being pinged
* Experimental Sniper headshot bleed is now uncurable. It cannot be reduced or removed by any source except resupplying
* Improved bullet impact effects
* Grenade Launcher tubes now rotate during reload
* Default viewmodel FOV is now 61 as a compromise for how minimized viewmodels frames certain weapon animations
* `-tickrate` launch option now uses the exact old tick interval of `0.015` when specifying `66`, to ensure proper legacy handling for servers which need it (jump/surf maps)
* Reduced the stutter from the friends list updating when entering the menu in-game
* Reduced the intensity of HDR to prevent materials from going overbright

**Fixes**

* Fixed an issue with the crouch timing being too short
* Fixed small damage numbers in Individual+Combined mode appearing during freeze cam, to prevent information about where the target went
* Fixed damage styles other than Individual+Combined mode appearing during freeze cam, to prevent information about where the target went
* Fixed an issue with a new bot name not appearing correctly
