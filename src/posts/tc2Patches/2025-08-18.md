## Update 1

**Changes**

* Fixed Revenge Crits and other self-boosted crits being consumed while crit boosted from another source
* Fixed pings not going through grates and windows
* Fixed pings lingering on enemy Spies who disguised or cloaked after being pinged
* Experimental Sniper headshot bleed is now uncurable. It cannot be reduced or removed by any source except resupplying
* Improved bullet impact effects
* Grenade Launcher tubes now rotate during reload
* Fixed Knife backstab having client desync and delay
* Default viewmodel FOV is now 61 as a compromise for how minimized viewmodels frames certain weapon animations
* `-tickrate` launch option now uses the exact old tick interval of `0.015` when specifying `66`, to ensure proper legacy handling for servers which need it (jump/surf maps)
* Reduced the stutter from the friends list updating when entering the menu in-game
* Reduced the intensity of HDR to prevent materials from going overbright

**Fixes**

* Fixed an issue with the crouch timing being too short
* Fixed small damage numbers in Individual+Combined mode appearing during freeze cam, to prevent information about where the target went
* Fixed damage styles other than Individual+Combined mode appearing during freeze cam, to prevent information about where the target went
* Fixed issues with some bot names
* Fixed Short Circuit not reducing the damage of direct Grenade Launcher hits

## Update 2

**Changes**

* Reworked backstab hit detection to truly once and for all, get rid of facestabs
  * To recap, an earlier update changed backstabs to only consider the Spy's view in order to determine if a backstab connected or not, disregarding if the victim reacted to the Spy on their end
  * This feels unfair to the victim, as if they react in time, they will be able to view the Spy backstabbing them i.e a "facestab"
  * Rather than favor the Spy or the victim, we now check both. All normal backstab conditions will be run from the perspective of the Spy, so that the Spy does not receive a backstab they did not themselves see.
  * In addition to the normal checks, an additional check will now run, checking if the victim reacted in time, and faced the Spy. If the Spy is tightly within the field of vision of the victim, the backstab will not connect.
  * This gives the best of both worlds: intuitive and responsive backstab checks that favor Spy, as well as an opportunity for the victim to turn around and look at the Spy during the latency discrepancy period.
* Added randomized loadouts to bots
