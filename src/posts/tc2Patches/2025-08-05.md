**Changes**

* Minigun now only fires an accurate bullet every 0.25 seconds (even while continuously firing)
* Dynamic crosshair now shows when Spy's revolvers are perfectly accurate
* Reverted Cow Mangler experimental change
* Added bunnyhopping cvars similar to CS for movement testing and custom gamemodes
* Updated to latest TF2 branch

**Fixes**

* Fixed regression causing the player to stop in place when bunnyhopping
* Made the respawn check for leaving spawn a bit more restrictive (cancels after moving too far from your initial spawn point)
