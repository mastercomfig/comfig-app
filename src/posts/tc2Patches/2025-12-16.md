* Improved reliability of new menu system
* Reverted the Beggar's Bazooka only consuming reserve ammo rather than clip when misfiring
    * This change affected balance more than we'd like at this stage of the mod's development, so we're reverting it.
* Fixed some maps that didn't work well with bots being used in official servers
* Fixed some view networking issues when spectating players in first person
* Fixed various stability issues on Linux
