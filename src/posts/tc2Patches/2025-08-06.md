**Changes**

* Made projectile spawns much smoother and less delayed on the client
* Any projectile that only affects enemies will now always pass through teammates (ex. rockets, grenades, Dragon's Fury fireball, Huntsman arrow, Sandman ball, Cleaver)
  * Even though teammates blocking projectiles after 0.25 seconds is intended to prevent spam through chokes, it is a confusing and random-feeling mechanic due to a variety of factors including networking and player movement.
* Fixed ground landing code not considering resultant velocity after collision with a slope (aka slope bug)
* Fixed the charge sound for the Stickybomb Launcher not stopping if the player dies while charging
* Disabled holidays and birthday beachball in competitive games, so that [this](https://www.twitch.tv/essentialstf/clip/SavageElegantQuailCharlieBitMe) doesn't happen
* Added `cl_crosshair_gap` ConVar to customize gap on crosshair
* Changed client net settings:
  * Made interp settings more intuitive / understandable. Clients can now set number of buffered snapshots as `cl_interp_ratio`.
  * Increased max interp ratio to 3 (from 2, base game defaults to 5, so this is still a reduction in max interp)
  * `cl_predict` can no longer be turned off. `cl_predictweapons` and `cl_lagcompensation` still work
  * Fixed being able to change restricted ConVars only allowed while spectating or disconnected
  * Fixed various exploits for cheating clients

**Fixes**

* Fixed enabling fixed spread on Demoman projectiles causing change in distance/arc. Now, projectiles have spin at a fixed value which will obtain an average arc.
  * This introduces some variance due to the physics simulation, but it is otherwise needed to maintain consistency for projectiles.
* Fixed servers not having packet drop protection
