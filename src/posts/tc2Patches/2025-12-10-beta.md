* Fixed Gas Passer damage boost and afterburn ligner not actually working
* Restored a few changes to the beta:
    * BLU building deactivated buildings during Setup
    * Wrangler shield active only when Sentry is disabled
    * Wrangler firing speed increased to actually double speed
    * Wrap Assassin damage, bleed and reward rework. Wrap Assasssin meter is refilled quicker from any bleed damage dealt by Scout. Shard damage is more consistent and bleeds in an AoE.
    * Ullapool Caber forced self-death and multiple subsequent explosions added back
    * Bison slows through enemies
