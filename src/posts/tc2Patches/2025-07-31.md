**Changes**

* Testing spread reworks:
  * Accuracy recovery time is now set to be 66% slower than firing rate, rather than being a fixed 1.25 seconds. Accuracy recovery time cannot be higher than the old fixed value, though.
    * Effectively, this means you can exchange lower ideal DPS for better accuracy / guaranteed DPS by tap firing guns like the Pistol and Revolver.
  * The Ambassador is now always accurate upon firing (still has the same 1 second cooldown for headshots)
  * Miniguns are now guaranteed to fire at least one pellet with perfect accuracy
  * Spread is now based upon a real Gaussian distribution (circular). This will improve evenness of pellet distribution.
* Testing changes to ping measurement

**Fixes**

* Fixed explosion trace leniency not working correctly
* Fixed issues with team status HUD class ordering in competitive modes
* Fixed issues with game end in match emulation modes
  * Fixed map not changing in match emulation modes
* Fixed respawn on switch being blocked during pre-game
* Fixed spawn doors not being locked during pre-round
* Added spawn point order is now dependent on class
* Fixed round / game intro only using the Casual variant
* Fixed tf_weapon_criticals not visibly changing in competitive modes (to prevent confusion for those who check the cvar)
* Fixed game starting too early in match emulation modes
