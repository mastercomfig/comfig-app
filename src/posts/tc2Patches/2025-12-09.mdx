    * Graphics options overhauled to provide much better control of TF2's performance and quality levels
    * Various settings have much better controls or added information to help explain what an option does
    * Various useful settings have been added to the menu
    * Some outdated/irrelevant options have been removed from the menu, so as to not overwhelm or confuse the user
    * Some settings, like keybinds, are still only available in the old menu. These settings will be ported over time, but for now, a button to open the old settings menu in areas where it is applicable.
