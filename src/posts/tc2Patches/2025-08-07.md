**Changes**

* Improved how secondary actions (like hauling buildings, cloaking, detonating stickyboms, etc) respond to player input
  * Secondary actions will constantly retry with a consistent 0.1 second cooldown if they failed to do anything
  * Secondary actions now consistently retry in every situation (switching weapons, reloading, attacking, etc.) instead of being delayed
  * Fixes the infamous "sticky detonation delay bug"
* Fixed building blueprint rotating initially while holding down secondary fire after hauling a building
* Further improved responsiveness of rockets by predicting their motion for the first 100ms
* Fixed prediction errors with modified gamerules gravity (thanks nosoop!)

**Fixes**

* Improved slope fix to respect certain in-air attributes
* Fixed Scout double jump when auto-bunnyhopping is enabled
