**Changes**

* 6s and Highlander no longer have reduced respawn times based upon player count. They will be based upon the standard respawn wave timer of 10 seconds by default.
  * This fixes an issue where disconnected players could influence their team's respawn time to be shorter.
  * Furthermore, this extends respawn times in 6s to the designed time. Since 6s is below the 8 player threshold per team for full respawn times, 6s always received a lowered respawn time by default.
  * We'll monitor the impact of this change and use it to devise a more suitable respawn time for 6s which isn't based upon a proportion of 8 player teams.
* BLU Engineers can now build in their respawn room during Setup time
  * Buildings built in this way are disabled until they are moved out of the respawn room
  * After Setup time is over, buildings cannot be placed in the respawn room
* Reworked Flying Guillotine:
  * Reduced impact damage from 50 to 10
  * Now instantly culls enemies with less than 30% health
  * Culling an enemy will instantly recharge the meter
  * Bleed and meter unchanged
* The Thermal Thruster:
  * Removed delays in switching and launching
  * No longer resets momentum
  * Increased push force from 250 to 500
* Medieval Mode:
  * The following weapons can now be used:
    * Rocket Jumper
    * Thermal Thruster
    * Gas Passer
    * Stickybomb Jumper
  * The following weapons can now be equipped but not deployed:
    * Baby Face's Blaster
    * Soda Popper
  * The Huo-Long Heater can now be activated but not fired
* Reduced SMG crit multiplier to 1.5x instead of 3x
