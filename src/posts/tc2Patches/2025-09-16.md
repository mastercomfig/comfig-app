**Changes**

* Fixed flamethrower DPS
  * Reworked flame density mechanic introduced in the Blue Moon Update from a glorified accuracy mechanic to one that is aware of the accuracy thresholds of the Flamethrower
  * New strategy is to simply track missed flames in between flame damage checks, reducing damage based upon the missed fraction, which provides a smoother ramp between actually missing flame damage checks, and only missing some particles in between.
