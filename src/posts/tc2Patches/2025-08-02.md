**Changes**

* Adjusted damage falloff
  * Partly reintroduced damage variation from random damage spread. 
  * Now, damage in falloff range (>512 units) will decrease gradually, down to the minimum damage variation at max falloff range (1024 units).
  * Effectively, this means weapons will do even less damage at longer range, **including weapons which normally ignore falloff** (Sniper Rifle and Grenade Launcher).
  * _We think there was a balance oversight when random damage spread was disabled by default. When it was disabled, we lost the variance at the lower end of damage. Although zero variance is the expected value for damage, in practice, damage thresholds were designed for damage spread to sometimes proc at the lower end. For example, with random damage spread on, grenades would sometimes do 90 damage, and this would have implications for thresholds beyond just the unpredictability. Although the randomness of this mechanic felt unfair, we think it's good to bring back the lower-end in a way which further encourages fights to take place at closer range, further emphasizing the falloff mechanic._
* Added respawn feature during the first 7 seconds after spawning. By pressing your Interact key during this time, you will respawn. This allows players to switch spawn rooms, and switch loadouts / class without a resupply locker.
  * If you leave the spawn room, you will no longer be able to use this feature.
* Fixed being under the effects of Bonk causing the player to take push force from damage in cases where it shouldn't apply

**Fixes**

* Reverted experimental changes except global ramp-up and spread changes
* Fixed teams not auto-readying when there was 6 players on each team in match emulation mode
