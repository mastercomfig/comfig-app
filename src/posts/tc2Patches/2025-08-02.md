**Changes**

* Fixed damage falloff not reaching the 102.4 unit tail-end due to a bug in how disabling random spread was implemented
* Added respawn feature during the first 7 seconds after spawning. By pressing your Interact key during this time, you will respawn. This allows players to switch spawn rooms, and switch loadouts / class without a resupply cabinet.
  * If you leave the spawn room, you will no longer be able to use this feature.
* Fixed being under the effects of Bonk causing the player to take push force from damage in cases where it shouldn't apply

**Fixes**

* Fixed teams not auto-readying when there was 6 players on each team in match emulation mode
