**Changes**

* Darwin's Danger Shield no longer provides full Afterburn Immunity. Instead, it gives the same level of Afterburn Protection as a Pyro has.
* Experimental Equalizer change (building upon yesterday):
  * Damage resistance scales from 20% at 50% health, to 50% at 10% health
* Fixed players not spawning on the match summary screen in some cases
* Fixed your own team showing up as blocked when teams were full in Sixes or Highlander modes
* Fixed being shown a class selection menu upon joining when teams are full
* Reduced the FPS impact of the friends panel when opening the main menu

**Fixes**

* Fixed backstabs not working reliably at very close distances
