<br /><br />
* Added a new "Classes" section to the menu with the new UI system
* Fixed scoreboard mouse mode not working properly while spectating
* Fixed Loadout button not working on the main menu
* Fixed crosshair style and download filter settings not working properly on the main menu
* Fixed chat messages accumulating too much over time, causing extreme client performance drops
* Gas Passer: cosmetic-only gas dripping effect now lingers after ignition, properly granting assists for the Gas Passer thrower and making the source of the afterburn more clear
* Actually added crash logging
