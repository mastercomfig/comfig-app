**Changes**

* Redesigned damage number display
  * Made damage numbers much more responsive and fixed various issues with their display and delay between updates
  * Batching damage numbers now still shows individual hits, as well as a batched number
  * Default damage batching window increased from 0.2 to 2 seconds
  * Redesigned damage number batching to be more satisfying and playful
  * Adjusted default damage number color to a more intense and high contrast red
* Added damage and kill hitmarkers
* Made min viewmodels the default. Although artistically intended to give the weapons weight and make the animations up front and center, the large weapon viewmodels make the game feel old, cramped and claustrophobic to newer players who are more accustomed to modern, more streamlined shooters.
* Fixed bots not waiting for the item switch timer before giving up on using their weapon
* Bots will no longer taunt in competitive games
* Added new bot names
* Fixed Cow Mangler self-kills using the wrong effect color
* Fixed an sv_pure exploit related to the sound system
* Various stability fixes
