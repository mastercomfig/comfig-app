**Changes**

* New spawn rules (applies to all modes):
  * Class switching or loadout changes off of initial spawn do not change your spawn location.
  * You can press the Inspect key (F by default) to switch spawn points after initially spawning. In Casual, this is unlimited. In Competitive, this is limited to one time.
  * Reasoning: changing spawn location from class switching is awkward and looks visually like a bug to those unfamiliar. This also gives the ability to players to choose between switching their spawn location or changing class.
* Engineers will now always hit their buildings within melee range through teammates and enemies, rather than only when the building is sapped. This will allow the Engineer to repair, refill ammo, upgrade, and construction boost their building even if someone is blocking it.
* Enemies now have hit priority for melee attacks if teammates are in the way.

**Fixes**

* Fixed spawn positions being preserved in various cases
