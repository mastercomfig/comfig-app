**Changes**

* Sentry Gun rockets and the Soldier Grenade taunt now use the same splash damage rules as other explosions
  * _This should make the splash damage slightly weaker, but more intuitive to players._
* Damage feedback changes:
  * Damage feedback now plays even when dead.
  * Improved damage feedback of bullets.
  * Changed damage feedback defaults to be more responsive to gameplay. Damage feedback settings will reset the first time you get into a game. **Please keep these the same for now, as we are testing new defaults.**
* Various minor optimizations and visual improvements
* `env_smokestack` map entity now supports up to 8 materials

**Fixes**

* Fixed a crash on the main menu
* Fixed some class selection sounds not playing
