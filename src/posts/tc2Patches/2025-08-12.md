**Changes**

* Added new messages surrounding loadout changes.
  * When loadout changes are available to be refreshed at a Resupply Cabinet, the game will notify the player to do so.
  * When automatic respawns are blocked in competitive games, the player is informed about this, and asked to head to a Resupply Cabinet
* Fixed loadout respawns not working properly for the following actions: Action Item equip prompts, quickswitches, loadout preset changes
* Fixed loadout changes possibly not respecting when the "Automatically respawn after loadout changes in respawn zones" option was disabled

**Fixes**

* Fixed "Automatically respawn after loadout changes in respawn zones" option not working correctly in SDK mods
* Fixed loadout/item changes being severely delayed in SDK mods
