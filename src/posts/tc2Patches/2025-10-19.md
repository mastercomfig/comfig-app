* Updated the main menu
  * Find a Game button now opens Quickplay
  * Server Browser added to the bottom bar
  * Various icon / UI adjustments for polish
* Competitive mode now spawns players around the contested point during pre-game, to enhance quality of warmup time
  * Can be turned off with tf_tournament_preround_spawns 0
  * Dynamically finds appropriate points to spawn players, which can be enhanced by generating a nav mesh for the map to find appropriate walkable areas
  * This removes the need for manually creating spawn points for community maps, by using the already present navmesh generation system for analysis
  * If a navmesh is not present, dynamic spawns fallback to a best-effort failsafe for finding appropriate spawn locations
  * All gamemodes except for Payload Race and CTF are supported at this time
* Reworked how pre-round time works in matchmaking matches. A similar rework is coming soon for normal play.
  * All pre-round setups are now consistent. Before, subsequent rounds had different rules compared to the match start pre-round, causing a huge difference in heal time and rollouts.
  * Here are the pre-round stages:
    * Countdown (10 seconds): all players are frozen and cannot perform any item actions
    * Pre-round time (3 seconds): all players are unfrozen and can perform any action, but spawn doors remain locked
    * Round start: spawn doors are unlocked
* Motion blur is now disabled by default, to keep up with modern player expectations
* Developer Console is now enabled by default, as a quality of life change for advanced players
* Large Combat Text is now enabled by default, as it compliments the Individual+Combined damage number mode well
* Adjusted default volume from 50% to 20% to further reduce risk of ear damage (preferring that players raise their volume up to a suitable level, rather than need to bring it down)
* Bots now spawn during match countdown, rather than on match start, so that bots can keep up with rollouts
* Fixed lag compensation errors caused by backstab ready viewmodel animations
* Fixed match ready countdown not displaying in some cases
* Fixed bot names getting out of sync on the server, which could cause bot commands to fail, and clients to receive the wrong name for the bot
* Fixed players with many items getting kicked upon connecting to a server
* Integrated some community fixes from the main TF2 branch
