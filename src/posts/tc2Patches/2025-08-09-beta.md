**Changes**

* Experimental Sandman changes:
  * Increased the base damage from 15 to 20
  * Slow now applies on hits at point blank range
  * Increased the base slow duration from 0.6 to 0.7 seconds
  * Maximum slow duration of 2 seconds unchanged
  * Slow duration now scales slower at close range, and ramps up to the maximum of 2 seconds at further away
  * Moonshots still provide a bonus 1 second slow duration
  * Halved the distance for a moonshot
  * Increased moonshot base damage from 23 to 30
  * Upon hitting a moonshot, Scout instantly replenishes his ball and Scout's next ball swing or melee attack is a guaranteed critical hit
* Experimental Wrap Assassin changes:
  * Base ornament damage remains at 15
  * Halved the distance for a moonshot
  * Shard damage now always does 4 damage, regardless of distance or direct hit. Previously, damage was inconsistent (dealing up to 14 damage) and sometimes did double damage upon player direct hit.
  * Shard damage now crits when the ornament crits. Note that the ornament always crits on a moonshot.
  * Critical shard damage applies a 5 second bleed in an AoE
