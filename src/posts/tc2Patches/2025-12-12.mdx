* Vote system updates:
    * Vote kicks are now enabled by default
    * Made extend level and next map votes separate by default
    * Next map choices vote now displays by default
    * Vote scramble is now disabled by default. We prefer the function of auto-scramble to keep the momentum of a fast-paced match before scrambling.

* Improved next map choices vote:
    * Fixed not automatically showing up when enabled
    * Fixed not starting when the game ends early due to not enough time to start the next round
    * Fixed not listing choices due to previous voting rework
    * Fixed not showing vote counts

* Added a vote to control random crits

* Updated the default MOTD to provide some helpful guidance to players

* Fixed Medic healing/injured outline colors not using the proper thresholds
* Fixed Medic healing/injured outlines not appearing in some cases
* Fixed blood particle effects appearing from fire damage
* Fixed bleed debuff causing invulnerable players to visibly bleed

* Fixed FPS getting locked to 30 in some cases

* Added a setting to control max chat lines. Defaults to 15 lines. Previously was unlimited and could cause performance issues after playing the game for a while.

* Bots now use "fill" quota mode by default: maintains a set player count of humans and bots
