**Changes**

* Team sizes now default to a 12v12, and can be adjusted with `tf_team_size`, `tf_team_size_red` and `tf_team_size_blu`, so that server operators can support extra spectator slots or create custom gamemodes
* Added improvements to the team menu to handle teams being full
* Enhanced weapon lighting to be softer
* Added various hitreg debugging convars
* Fixed various issues with subtick
* Fixed various issues with lag compensation
* Added extra crit visual effects for when the shooter lands a headshot
* Fixed tracers for other players being spawned incorrectly
* Fixed an issue where tracers would spawn every other shot, regardless of if there was a large time in between shots. Examples:
  * Tap firing the Pistol with perfect accuracy will produce a tracer for each shot
  * Revolvers will always create a tracer for each shot

**Fixes**

* Fixed more than one head trauma from the same Sniper Rifle being active at once in rare cases
