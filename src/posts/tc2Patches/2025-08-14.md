**Changes**

* Medigun no longer causes view stutters on healing
* Medigun now has different sounds based upon healing state, to better distinguish between hurt, overhealing and fully buffed players
* Medic auto callers is now default
* Hide crosshair while scoped is now default
* Fixed an issue where ammo would be consumed upon finishing a reload, when the clip was already resupplied
* Overloading Beggar's Bazooka expends reserve ammo, rather than loaded rockets
* The Soda Popper and Force-A-Nature no longer lose their clip on reload. Given that auto-reload is default, the previous behavior was unavoidable and could be frustrating to players.
* Fixed firing being delayed after reloading (thanks chrb22!)
* Changing class outside of a respawn room while auto-kill is off will now display a message regarding how to respawn as your new class
