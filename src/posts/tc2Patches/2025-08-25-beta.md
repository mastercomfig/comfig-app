**Changes**

* Soda Popper:
  * Leaned more into the "earn extra jumps with damage" stat. Hype drains at a speed to allow for damage to earn you extra jumps, and by default, Hype does not give you a window to do more than 2 extra jumps without dealing damage
  * Now instantly reloads upon double jump, rather than always while in air from a double jump.
* Ambassador:
  * Reduced initial damage by 5%
  * Improved falloff at long distances vs. other revolvers
* Air Strike:
  * Reduced spread while rocket jumping
