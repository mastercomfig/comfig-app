**Changes**

* Ambassador:
  * -30% critical damage penalty
  * Removed cooldown for headshots
  * Reduced falloff for headshots
  * _While giving Spy headshots on his revolvers improves his damage output and situational effectiveness, and increases the opportunity cost of using the L'Etranger, the Ambassador should still be the principle execution weapon for Spy. This restores a bit of its power and feeling over the other revolvers for this capability._
* Soda Popper:
  * Now instantly reloads while air dashing
  * Hype no longer drains over time
  * While Hyped, consume 40% hype on air dash
  * Hype meter can be increased while hyped
* Improved secondary explosive behavior on the Ullapool Caber

**Fixes**

* Fixed getting slowed down while being healed by a Medic
* Fixed caber secondary explosion not using the correct icon in the killfeed
