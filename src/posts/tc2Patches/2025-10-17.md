* Damage numbers now become visible if you turn the corner onto an enemy you had hit from behind the corner
* Changed the default for mp_spectators_restricted to 1, as used in matchmaking servers. This makes it so switching to spectator is not possible if it would unbalance the teams.
* Fixed a crash on Linux dedicated servers related to updating loadouts
* Fixed a server freeze on Windows related to stranded spawn mechanic
* Temporarily reverted deathcam persistence bug fix, as it was causing issues in other cases
* Attempted a fix for main menu music playing after a map change
* Eureka Effect now plays deny sound when teleport menu is not ready yet
