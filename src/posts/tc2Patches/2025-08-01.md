**Changes**

* Testing what should be a minor ramp-up fix:
  * Though this change should provide very small adjustments to damage ramp-up (in the range of a 1-3 damage increase), changing such a fundamental mechanic must be tested.
  * Ramp-up now considers the closest possible distance the attacker and victim can be to each other, rather than max ramp-up only being applied if they were inside each other perfectly.
  * This should make max damage from ramp-up more intuitive and consistent.

**Fixes**

* Fix some player respawn bugs
* Fixed Pyro density mechanic not actually being disabled
