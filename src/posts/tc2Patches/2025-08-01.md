**Changes**

* Experimental Ullapool Caber rework:
  * Detonating the Caber explodes in your face, dealing massive lethal self-damage.
  * Increased the explosion radius to the standard 146 units used for explosives, up from 100.
  * Increased falloff to the standard amount used for explosives. This means it will deal less damage than before away from the explosion center.
  * These new Cabers seem a bit defective! Some of its munitions now explode later.
  * Initial explosive damage to enemies decreased from 75 to 50 damage.
  * The Caber will then fall to the ground, exploding after 0.7 seconds and dealing 100 damage.
  * The secondary explosion will be crit-boosted if the initial attack was a crit.
  * _This will restore some of the prior effectiveness of the Caber, now lethal to a Medic at max health, while giving some tradeoffs and counterplay vs. the older design. The newer design is an effective last resort panic option for the Demoman, and does not need to be resupplied due to its lethal self-damage. It gives an opportunity for the Demoman to deal similar damage as before the nerf, while also giving an opportunity to enemies to avoid it._
  * Note that we have also fixed some damage inconsistency issues with this weapon previously, which allows it to apply relatively consistent damage upon impact, also contributing to making it more pleasant to use.
* Testing what should be a minor ramp-up fix:
  * Though this change should provide very small adjustments to damage ramp-up (in the range of a 1-3 damage increase), changing such a fundamental mechanic must be tested.
  * Ramp-up now considers the closest possible distance the attacker and victim can be to each other, rather than max ramp-up only being applied if they were inside each other perfectly.
  * This should make max damage from ramp-up more intuitive and consistent.

**Fixes**

* Fix some player respawn bugs
