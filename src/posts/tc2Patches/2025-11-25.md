* Updated to latest TF2 changes. Excluded the following changes:
    * Thermal Thruster fix revert
        * We're keeping the Thermal Thruster fix, as keeping various effects on both a Pyro and Medic without the item is not a good solution to usage preferences of Pyros which led to the revert. We will be investigating solutions that address the issues instead of breaking intent through bugs.
    * Reverted change which causes throwables to explode when thrown right against a wall. Instead, the current TC2 change is kept which prevents throwing and thus wasting a charge in this case.
* Fixed self-knockback from blast jumping being blocked while under the effects of a Quick Fix Übercharge if the explosion damaged an enemy
* Fixed Diamondback revenge crits being earnable while using other revolvers
* Fixed Rage meters being shared between Soldier banners when switching items outside of a respawn room
* Fixed various crashes and other issues when using Rage meters in custom mods
