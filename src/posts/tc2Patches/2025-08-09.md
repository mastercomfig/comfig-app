**Changes**

* Fixed a potential fire interval bypass on empty weapons
* Fixed a case of retrying a secondary action not working if it was denied on the same tick as a melee swing
* Moonshot slow now plays the base stun sound as well as the moonshot sound, so slow application always plays a distinct sound
* Jarate, Mad Milk and the Gas Passer will now only collide with allies if they need extinguishing. Otherwise, they will pass through allies.
  * Fixed the Gas Passer not colliding with allies if they need extinguishing (thanks Marxvee!)
* Fixed some more collision and expiration bugs with the Sandman ball and Wrap Assassin bauble
* Fixed trails disappearing too soon on the Wrap Assassin bauble (thanks Marxvee!)
* Experimental Sandman changes:
  * Increased the base damage from 15 to 20
  * Slow now applies on hits at point blank range
  * Increased the base slow duration from 0.6 to 0.7 seconds
  * Maximum slow duration of 2 seconds unchanged
  * Slow duration now scales slower at close range, and ramps up to the maximum of 2 seconds at further away
  * Moonshots still provide a bonus 1 second slow duration
  * Halved the distance for a moonshot
  * Increased moonshot base damage from 23 to 30
  * Upon hitting a moonshot, Scout instantly replenishes his ball and Scout's next ball swing or melee attack is a guaranteed critical hit
* Experimental Wrap Assassin changes:
  * Base ornament damage remains at 15
  * Halved the distance for a moonshot
  * Shard damage now always does 4 damage, regardless of distance or direct hit. Previously, damage was inconsistent (dealing up to 14 damage) and sometimes did double damage upon player direct hit.
  * Shard damage now crits when the ornament crits. Note that the ornament always crits on a moonshot.
  * Critical shard damage applies a 5 second bleed in an AoE
