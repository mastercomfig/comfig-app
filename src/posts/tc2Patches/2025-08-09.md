**Changes**

* Fixed a potential fire interval bypass on empty weapons
* Fixed a case of retrying a secondary action not working if it was denied on the same tick as a melee swing
* Moonshot slow now plays the base stun sound as well as the moonshot sound, so slow application always plays a distinct sound
* Jarate, Mad Milk and the Gas Passer will now only collide with allies if they need extinguishing. Otherwise, they will pass through allies.
  * Fixed the Gas Passer not colliding with allies if they need extinguishing (thanks Marxvee!)
* Fixed some more collision and expiration bugs with the Sandman ball and Wrap Assassin bauble
* Fixed trails disappearing too soon on the Wrap Assassin bauble (thanks Marxvee!)
