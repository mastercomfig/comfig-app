* Fixed Sniper Rifle not firing bullets due to yesterday's firing fixes
* Fixed some pure server exploits related to the sound system
* Temporarily disabled the func_nobuild entity so that testing / QC can be done for various building placement exploits masked by mapping workarounds
* Airborne status (commonly used for the Market Gardener) is now preserved for a guaranteed 60ms (up from 15ms), to further reduce the impact of networking conditions
* Unducking in the air is now prevented in cases where it would cause you to become grounded
  * Note that this expands an already present grounding check by two units, to include the two unit threshold from the ground, rather than merely checking the ground level directly
  * This fixes an issue where on 64 tick / substepped movement, crouch tapping could cause the player to become grounded due to slight differences in jump height steps per tick
  * This also fixes a potential issue while rocket jumping and momentarily letting go of crouch causing you to become grounded on a ramp
