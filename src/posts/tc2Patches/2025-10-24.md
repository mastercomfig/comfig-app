* Updated to latest TF2 changes
    * Note: current TF2 changes as of the [October 23, 2025 patch](https://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=255293) cause server hosts to not receive item requests. Server hosts should avoid updating their TF2 dedicated server files from the latest Steam depot until a fix is applied by Valve. Players cannot use their item inventory when locally hosting their own servers in game for the time being.
    * Reverted "Fixed a bug where Gas Passer gas can cover players with gas in spawn rooms" from TF2, as the change does not fix the actual gas penetration issues, nor does it work consistently on all maps (thanks Bitl!)
    * Fixed crash caused by "Fixed KeyValues memory leak in birds" from TF2 (thanks Bitl!)
* Fixed Eureka Effect menu reopening (thanks klo70!)
* Fixed TFBot crash related to moving control points (thanks TheBetaM!)
* Fixed Thermal Thruster stomp condition lingering in some cases (thanks bakugo!)
* Fixed Vaccinator icons persisting on disguised Spies (thanks bakugo!)
* Fixed TF bots not working on some gamemodes without a clear objective (based upon changes from ShowinGrowin, thanks!)
