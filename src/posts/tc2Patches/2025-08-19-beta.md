**Changes**

* Projectiles now collide against a player's cylinder hitbox rather than a non-rotating bounding box
* Competitive games no longer restrict spectating while dead. You can freely move around, spectate any map object or teammate as you wish.
  * Instead, visibility of enemy players is now restricted in competitive games while spectating. You can only see what your team sees.

**Fixes**

* Disabled experiment for disabling fall damage
