**Changes**

* Head trauma duration now stacks rather than refreshing. So, getting two headshots in a row will result in a bleed that lasts for a total of 8 seconds, rather than the 4 second duration being reset. This results in similar damage for successive headshots as before.
* Head trauma now causes a gruesome, bloody death
