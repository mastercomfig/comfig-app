**Changes**

* Competitive respawn changes:
  * Automatic respawns are defined as respawns done within the spawn room, as a consequence of changing loadout or class
  * You cannot automatically respawn if you have taken damage or moved
  * You can switch spawn rooms (change to forward/back spawn) once per life by pressing the Interact key (default F) within 7 seconds of your initial spawn
  * Automatic respawns will respawn you at your initial spawn location
* Fixed various issues with the game thinking you respawned during networking issues
* Fixed an issue with new contracts not displaying in the spawn room in certain cases
* Fixed being able to ping during match summary time
* Fixed resupply cabinet not actually setting out-of-combat state ("crit heals")
