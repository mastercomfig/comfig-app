**Changes**

* Quick ping feature improvements:
  * Ping no longer labels various world entities
  * Ping labels payload cart properly for pushers/blockers
  * Ping no longer works on disguised enemy spies
  * Ping now only lasts for 4 seconds in comp
  * Ping now fades out faster if you are looking at it
  * Ping transparency reduced
  * Fixed ping not working for some players
  * Fixed ping showing up on match summary stage
  * Fixed alignment issues on pings
  * Reduced the size of pings in comp

* Enabled third person spectating in competitive modes
  * Visibility of players and other objects is blocked based upon the view of the player you are spectating
  * In the future, we will enable fly cam spectating based upon the shared vision of your team, and improve the accuracy of vision around corners/behind walls so as to not leak any information while in a competitive match.
  * We are aware this still gives an advantage. However, we would like to experiment with dead players contributing to strategy/planning in competitive modes.

* Experimental Soda Popper changes:
  * Damage to fill Hype reduced from 400 to 160

* Experimental Sandman changes:
  * Critical baseballs from a moonshot boost no longer give a free ball upon hitting another moonshot
  * No random critical hits
  * Fixed crit boost on Sandman lingering upon respawn in some cases
  * In Mann vs. Machine, the Sandman will now be able to stun both robots and players

* Experimental Wrap Assassin changes:
  * No recharge time bonus
  * Gains recharge based on bleed damage dealt
  * Recharge gained from one second of bleed: 0.25 seconds
  * No random critical hits

* Experimental Righteous Bison changes:
  * Projectile moves slower through enemies
  * Deals damage every 100ms, rather than 25ms

* Experimental Spy changes:
  * Decloak attack delay reduced from 2 seconds to 1.4 seconds. For knives it is further reduced down to 0.9 seconds
  * Note that decloak time remains at 2 seconds. So you will be able to attack slightly before becoming fully visible.
  * Cloak time reduced from 1 second to 0.7 seconds

* Experimental L'Etranger changes:
  * Can fire while cloaked

**Fixes**

* Fixed custom mod strings not loading properly
