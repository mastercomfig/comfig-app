* As a Medic, you will now see outlines for injured teammates and teammates calling for Medic
* Limited Medic auto-call threshold to up to 75% to prevent "radar" exploit for finding non-injured teammates
* High skill competitive matches now enable pre-round damage push forces
    * With this mode, match countdowns are adjusted to allow for a rollout during the last 3 seconds of pre-round
    * Developer note: _Disabling pre-round push adversely affects the early rollout vs. extra overheal tradeoff that heavily impacts play in high skill games. Although this is a non-ideal solution, it's best that we do not disrupt high level competitive play for now._
* Further enhanced the pre-game in competitive games with an on-kill refresh:
    * Weapon clips are replenished
    * Item meters are refilled
    * 50HP heal buff is granted
* Competitive matches will now require at least one person on each team to ready up for the match start countdown to start
    * High skill matches require all players to ready up before the match starts
    * If a player goes AFK, they automatically unready
* Fixed CTF flag carrier outline not showing up when you were invisible
* Fixed CTF flag carrier outline not showing properly while spectating
* Fixed gamemodes with setup time having a "fast" first blood after setup gates open
* Updated the materials for the resupply cabinet

* Fixed missing player decal materials for player slots 65 to 100
