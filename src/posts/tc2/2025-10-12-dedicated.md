You may have noticed that we've been a bit quiet lately. Some of you speculated that we abandoned the project to pursue our lifelong dream of becoming professional penguin sledders. Others assumed we'd been kidnapped. The truth is much, much scarier: a scarecrow has been standing menacingly outside our office since the start of October, and we’ve been too afraid to go outside. So, holed up in our deepest, darkest basement with nothing but stale corn and even staler pumpkin spice coffee, we did the only thing we could: get Linux dedicated servers working. Now TC2 has servers of its own and anyone looking to start their own community server enterprise can follow [our new guide](https://github.com/mastercomfig/tc2/wiki/Dedicated-Server-(Linux)) to set one up.

And we've launched **two 24/7 dedicated servers of our own** to celebrate. Now you can easily hop into a match with your friends without having to awkwardly explain arcane commands or having to bribe one of them to host. You can find them in TC2's server browser by clicking "FIND A GAME":

* Official Comtress Casual Server (Chicago#1)
* Official Comtress Competitive Server (Chicago#1) 

They _are_ in Chicago only for the time being. Why Chicago? It's a city of broad shoulders and, more importantly, a city far away from this terrifying scarecrow. But we're working on getting servers online soon in Europe, Asia, and more (not Mars though). These server racks aren't cheap, and our primary source of income is currently "whatever we find in the couch cushions." If you’d like to help us speed up the global rollout, consider helping us [fund the next server rack](https://docs.comfig.app/latest/support_me/). And a huge thanks to Mothership and [swiftnode.net](https://swiftnode.net/?utm_source=comfig), who generously sponsored these first two servers so you'd have something to play on!

These servers behave similarly to a matchmaking server, along with our tweaks to make things more streamlined and fun. We've heard your feedback—mostly the loud, angry kind, which is our favorite—and we're hammering away at more improvements. We're currently drawing up plans on a cocktail napkin to:

* Make finding a game less of a scavenger hunt. A better quickplay UI is on the way.
* Making Casual games actually casual again. Drop-in and drop-out of Casual games, and bringing back team scrambles.
* Slashing the downtime between matches. Less talk, more fight!
* Making the jump to Competitive slightly less terrifying for new players. (We're aiming for "lightly mauled by a bear" instead of "vaporized by a laser")

We hope to have more to show you soon. Until then, enjoy the autumn season, and if you see a scarecrow: don't make eye contact.
