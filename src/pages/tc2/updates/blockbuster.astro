      <p class="lead" style="font-size: 1.5rem">
        As it turns out, there were a <em>few</em> gameplay bugs in TF2. Well, hundreds
        of them. So we've been listening to your feedback, and have made changes
        and fixes to the game based on what we've heard.

          CORE GAMEPLAY
        </h2>
        <ul class="lead">
          <li>
            Fixed switch speed bonuses not being used for applying a holster
            speed bonus. For example, The Degreaser's holster bonus was only
            applied after it has been deployed for the base deploy time (0.5
            seconds), rather using the deploy time with its switch bonus (0.33
            seconds). This caused an awkward situation where you had to wait
            longer than expected to benefit from The Degreaser's holster bonus.
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Fixed holster speed penalties, such as on The Fists of Steel,
              being bypassable.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fixed holster speed bonuses being able to be accidentally
              cancelled by switching through multiple weapons.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            Fixed movement speed slows not being applied consistently from
            weapons like from the Natascha and the Sandman.
          </li>
          <li>
            Resupplying now removes in-combat penalties from recently taking
            damage, aka giving "crit heals".
          </li>
          <li>
            Added lag compensation for teammates, to fix issues with players
            unexpectedly blocking bullets and The Sydney Sleeper extinguish not
            applying as expected.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed damage to buildings rounding down instead of up like damage to
            players.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed melee random critical hits damage range boost being 0-&gt;533
            damage for 15%-&gt;60% chance instead of 0-&gt;1600 damage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed random critical hits damage range boost being 0-&gt;533 damage
            for 2%-&gt;8% chance instead of 0-&gt;800 damage for 2%-&gt;12%
            chance.
          </li>
          <li>Added Medic Ãœbercharge amount to the Match Status HUD.</li>
          <li>
            Changed pre-round freeze logic to match Casual/Competitive
            matchmaking: the last 3 seconds of pre-round time unfreezes movement
            before starting the round, to allow players to move from their spawn
            position to the doors. Spawn doors are now also locked during this
            time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed pre-round movement freeze not working correctly (requiring
            weapon switching, not being timed correctly, etc).
          </li>
          <li>Fixed movement taunts being usable during freeze time.</li>
          <li>
            Fixed firing speeds being slightly inaccurate/delayed in some cases.
          </li>
          <li>
            Explosions now check in a 5% inner radius for a trace, so that small
            differences in geometry do not block explosion damage entirely. This
            is a 8 point box additional check if the center point fails, and
            damage is scaled based on how many points hit.
          </li>

            Respawn rooms no longer give instant respawns in competitive games.

          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed class limit being bypassable if two or more players switched
            to that class during a respawn wave.
          </li>
          <li>
            Added a reset class button for 6s games to allow class swapping
            without conflicting with class limits, like Highlander.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spawn points are now selected based on the player's class, to
            improve consistency in spawns.

          <li>Improved support for 6s class selection and limits.</li>

            <li>Added chat messages for class switching.</li>
            <li>Added team wipe announcer messages.</li>
            <li>
              Fixed Contract messages appearing in community competitive. We
              love you Miss Pauling, but that job can wait until after the
              scrim.
            </li>
            <li>
              Disabled dominations, soldier statue, item notifications and

            projectile's effects to exactly its range of 3000.
            <br />Developer note:
            <em
              >The Dragon's Fury range is not like most weapons. It has a
              physics based projectile which tries to stop itself before
              overextending its range, but due to this and the larger projectile
              radius, it was changed to have a smaller radius to prevent issues
              with the front of the fireball touching players way past its
              range. Now, the fireball is hard limited to only affect players it
              hits if they were actually within the distance range, rather than
              if they simply touched the fireball at any distance. Thus, we have
              restored the original radius, making the fireball more intuitive
              and less awkward to aim, while fixing unfair cases of hits.</em
