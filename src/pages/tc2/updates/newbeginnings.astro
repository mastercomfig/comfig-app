                href="https://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=2221"
                >changed in 2009</a
              >, the intention was to make random critical hits more skill /
              performance based for non-melee random crits. Thus, the values for
              crit chance and crit chance boost were changed. However, due to
              crit chance being shared between melee and non-melee, melee random
              crit chance was affected, keeping the chance boost based on damage
              the same, but more than halving the damage required to gain the
              max boost. This runs counter to the stated intention: less skill /
              performance is needed for the same high crit chance. Furthermore,
              due to how the chance boosts were applied, non-melee only got a
              max 8% chance based upon 533 damage, rather than the stated 12%
              chance from 800 damage, reducing the peak reward from your
              performance. These fixes now separate melee crit chance boost from
              non-melee, thus allowing melee to retain its 4x boost from 1600
              damage, while non-melee now has a 6x boost from 800 damage.</small

                ><em>Developer Note:</em> Although fixed spread was on average equal
                to random spread, maximum values for random spread still could proc
                much wider spread than fixed spread, resulting in real gameplay balance
                differences. This issue was further exacerbated by the incorrect
                random distribution of spread. Rather than attempting to reconcile
                the differences between casual and competitive play, we find it best
                to disable random bullet spread for all modes, making risk/reward
                at each distance consistent, similarly to disabling random damage
                spread.</small

          </ul>
          <li>
            Spread is now based upon a real Gaussian distribution (circular).
            This will improve evenness of pellet distribution.
          </li>
          <li>
            Single-shot guns like the Pistol and Revolver now recover their
            accuracy 66% slower than their fire rate, rather than a fixed 1.25
            second cooldown. Accuracy recovery time cannot be lower than 0.25
            seconds or higher than 1.25 seconds.

              Effectively, this means you can exchange lower ideal DPS for

            Reintroduced damage ranges seen on certain no-falloff weapons when
            random damage spread was enabled, by integrating them into
            falloff/rampup.

            <li>
              <small
                ><em>Developer Note:</em> Falloff/rampup is an integral part of Team
                Fortress 2, dictating ideal ranges for fights, thus balancing engagements.
                So it's an incredibly powerful attribute when a weapon ignores falloff.
                We decided to reintroduce damage threshold variance as seen in damage
                spread for these weapons, and integrate them in a way which follows
                the general distance-based engagement rules of Team Fortress 2.

        <h3 class="h5" style="font-weight: 600">General Weapon Changes</h3>
        <ul class="lead">
          <li>
            Fixed switch speed bonuses not being used for applying a holster
            speed bonus. For example, The Degreaser's holster bonus was only
            applied after it has been deployed for the base deploy time (0.5
            seconds), rather using the deploy time with its switch bonus (0.33
            seconds). This caused an awkward situation where you had to wait
            longer than expected to benefit from The Degreaser's holster bonus.
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Fixed holster speed penalties, such as on The Fists of Steel,
              being bypassable.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fixed holster speed bonuses being able to be accidentally
              cancelled by switching through multiple weapons.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            Fixed movement speed slows not being applied consistently from
            weapons like from the Natascha and the Sandman.
          </li>
          <li>
            Added lag compensation for teammates, to fix issues with players
            unexpectedly blocking bullets and The Sydney Sleeper extinguish not
            applying as expected.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed firing speeds being slightly inaccurate/delayed in some cases.
          </li>
          <li>
            Explosions now check in a 4% inner radius for a trace, so that small
            differences in geometry do not block explosion damage entirely. This
            is a 8 point box additional check if the center point fails, and
            damage is scaled based on how many points hit.
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We are aware this changes the behavior of sticky traps. However,
              following this change you should be damaged by them if and only if
              you can see the stickies, so fairness should be maintained.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            Fixed damage to buildings rounding down instead of up like damage to
            players.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="h5" style="font-weight: 600">Pre-Round</h3>
        <ul class="lead">
          <li>
            Changed pre-round freeze logic to match Casual/Competitive
            matchmaking: the last 3 seconds of pre-round time unfreezes movement
            before starting the round, to allow players to move from their spawn
            position to the doors. Spawn doors are now also locked during this
            time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed pre-round movement freeze not working correctly (requiring
            weapon switching, not being timed correctly, etc).
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed movement taunts being usable during freeze time in some cases.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="h5" style="font-weight: 600">Misc</h3>
        <ul class="lead">
          <li>
            Added respawn feature during the first 7 seconds after spawning. By
            pressing your Interact key (default F) during this time, you will
            respawn. This allows players to switch spawn rooms, and switch
            loadouts / class without a resupply cabinet. If you leave the spawn
            room, you will no longer be able to use this feature.
          </li>
          <li>
            Resupplying now removes in-combat penalties from recently taking
            damage, aka giving "crit heals".
