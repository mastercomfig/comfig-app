      <p class="lead">
        Hi, server owners! Thanks for your interest in comfig quickplay, and
        your continued support of the TF2 community. This page documents
        information for you all to better understand the quickplay system here,
        and how we can work together to improve the experience for our players
        and the community as a whole.
      </p>
      <h2 class="display-6 fw-bold">How are servers selected?</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        We want to provide players with an experience they expect, and must
        generally follow default TF2 gameplay rules (excluding a few
        preference-based exceptions), without adverse modifications which
        players looking for an unmodified casual experience do not want. As long
        as you strive to give players this kind of quality experience without
        deceiving them, you will be eligible to receive quickplay players. There
        is a full set of requirements, and a schedule for when they will be
        enforced. We are super open with talking to server owners about this and
        adjusting as needed.
      </p>
      <h3 class="fw-bold">Requirements</h3>
      <p class="lead">
        To avoid catching people off guard with the quickplay system, and to
        improve the server browsing experience in general, we are proposing
        different milestones of quickplay eligibility: M0, M1, M2, M3 and M4.
        This is of course subject to change pending feedback from all of you! If
        you do not meet the eligibility requirements, you will simply be
        suspended from being listed on quickplay, and we would be happy to
        reinstate anyone who would like work on compliance. The current
        milestone in effect is M0.
      </p>
      <h4>M0</h4>
      <p class="lead">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Servers must be listed on the server browser, and must not use
            strict matchmaking.
          </li>
          <li>Servers should not be password protected.</li>
          <li>Servers must have VAC enabled.</li>
          <li>Servers must have a public, non-SDR IP.</li>
          <li>
            Servers must be running on a dedicated server (srcds, not a listen
            server).
          </li>
          <li>The server must at least have a max player cap of 18.</li>
          <li>The server must be running any active Casual rotation map.</li>
          <li>
            The server must not have the following tags: <code
              >friendlyfire, highlander, trade, noquickplay, hidden</code
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Servers that violate <a
              href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6862-8119-C23E-EA7B"
            >
              the community guidelines
            </a> may be delisted.
          </li>
          <li>
            Servers must not actively trick players or lie to them or make it
            difficult for them to find what they are looking for. Servers must
            report accurate information about itself to the Steam infrastructure
            and to clients.
          </li>
          <li>
            All of the information in the server browser must be accurate:
            number of players, number of bots, map, ping, region, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bots must be easily identified by players as bots. Do not give a bot
            an avatar or assign it a ping value.
          </li>
          <li>
            Servers cannot name themselves according to the naming conventions
            used by Valve, or any other server organization.
          </li>
          <li>
            Servers must not be malicious, by exposing clients to malware or
            spyware, or by bypassing <code>cl_disablehtmlmotd</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The engine uses tags to communicate to clients that certain
            modifications are in effect. Servers must use these tags properly.
            If a server makes these modifications using built-in engine
            functionality, they will be set automatically, and all a server
            needs to do is make sure they don't actively block them from
            working. However, if the server uses a plugin to make gameplay
            modifications with very similar effects, it is THEIR responsibility
            to ensure that the tags are set. Players do not care how the
            gameplay modification was implemented, they just want to know
            whether it is active or not.
          </li>
          <li>
            Here are some examples of tags that must be set accurately:
            <code
              >friendlyfire, respawntimes, norespawntime, increased_maxplayers,
              nocrits, dmgspread, highlander</code
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            No opening a MOTD window (hidden or visible) that is not requested
          </li>
          <li>No forcing clients to view the MOTD until a timer has expired</li>
          <li>No browser popups</li>
          <li>No giving or selling gameplay advantage to players</li>
          <li>No kicking players to make room for reserved slots</li>
          <li>No modifying stock maps, models, or materials</li>
          <li>
            No running non-default game modes: prop hunt, dodgeball, class wars,
            randomizer, engineer fortress, etc
          </li>
          <li>
            No running non-default addons like custom weapons, x10, all crits,
            etc
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h4>M1</h4>
      <p class="lead">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Usage of Roll the Dice (RTD) must be labeled with the <code
              >rtd</code
            > tag.
          </li>
          <li>
            Usage of any class limits must be labeled with the <code

            > tag.
          </li>
          <li>
            Banning any classes must be labeled with the <code>classbans</code>
            tag.

      <h4>M2</h4>
      <p class="lead">
        <ul>
          <li>
            No granting or modifying economy items, or taking actions that
            devalue players' items, or interfering with the TF2 economy. This
            was enforced in the old Quickplay system.
          </li>
          <li>
            You must advertise your game name as "Team Fortress", the default.
            This was enforced in the old Quickplay system.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h4>M3</h4>
      <p class="lead">
        <ul>
          <li>
            You must respond to A2S pings from the game server. You may respond
            to A2S through a proxy, but all responses must not be cached and be
            traceable directly to the game server per request. Anycast solutions
            which improve client routing and reduce ping are commendable, but
            players must be able to see an accurate ping in the server browser
            to the actual game server.
          </li>
          <li>
            No using invalid characters in the server name in order to increase
            its sorting order.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h4>M4</h4>
      <p class="lead">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Servers must be registered with a
            <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/dev/managegameservers"
              >game server account</a
            >
            tied to an owning Steam account, and log into that account when the server
            boots using <code>sv_setsteamaccount</code>.
          </li>
          <li>Server accounts must be in good standing on Steam.</li>
          <li>Servers should not be password protected.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2 class="display-6 fw-bold">You said there was a map requirement?</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Yes, if your server is running a map which is not in the active Casual
        rotation, then players will not be directed to your server through
        quickplay. It's fine to switch to a custom map afterwards, and players
        can stay on your server in this case, or they can choose to leave. Once
        you switch back to an active Casual map, players will be directed to
        your server again. Work and investigation is ongoing in this area for
        custom maps.
      </p>
      <h2 class="display-6 fw-bold">What's the active Casual map rotation?</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Any map that is listed in the Casual matchmaking group will be eligible
        for quickplay. This update dynamically, so holiday maps like for Scream
        Fortress and Smissmas will only be active during the holiday.
      </p>
      <h2 class="display-6 fw-bold">How do you get this data?</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        We use the public server browser list and server query information. If
        you're open to players from the public, quickplay will evaluate your
        eligibility and send players your way.
      </p>
      <h2 class="display-6 fw-bold">How can I opt-out?</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        We provide a few ways to opt-out. Some are explicit, like the
        noquickplay tag (which you can set using <code
          >tf_server_identity_disable_quickplay 1</code
        >), or the hidden tag (which removes you from public server lists, can
        be set using <code>tf_mm_strict 2</code>).
        <br />
        There's also some implicit ways. If you run a server which isn't eligible
        for quickplay, like a surf, jump, or other custom gamemode server, obviously
        you don't have to worry about opting out.
      </p>
      <h2 class="display-6 fw-bold">How do I talk with you?</h2>
      <p class="lead">
