      <p class="lead">
        Hi, server owners! Thanks for your interest in comfig quickplay, and
        your continued support of the TF2 community. This page documents
        information for you all to better understand the quickplay system here,
        and how we can work together to improve the experience for our players
        and the community as a whole.
      </p>
      <h2 class="display-6 fw-bold">How are servers selected?</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        We want to provide players with an experience they expect, and servers
        must generally follow default TF2 gameplay rules (excluding a few
        preference-based exceptions), without adverse modifications which
        players looking for an unmodified casual experience do not want. As long
        as you strive to give players this kind of quality experience without
        deceiving them, you will be eligible to receive quickplay players. There
        is a full set of requirements, and a schedule for when they will be
        enforced. We are super open with talking to server owners about this and
        adjusting as needed.
      </p>
      <h3 class="fw-bold">Requirements</h3>
      <p class="lead">
        The vast majority of our requirements are things already stated to be in
        effect by Valve, for their own Quickplay eligibility and even server
        browser eligibility. However, to avoid catching server owners off guard
        with this new quickplay system, and to improve the server browsing
        experience in general, we are proposing different milestones of
        quickplay eligibility: M0, M1, M2, M3 and M4. This is of course subject
        to change pending feedback from all of you! If you do not meet the
        eligibility requirements, you will simply be suspended from being listed
        on quickplay, and we would be happy to reinstate anyone who would like
        to work on compliance. The current milestone in effect is M0. Meeting
        higher milestones not in effect gives your server a rank bonus.
      </p>
      <h4>M0</h4>
      <p class="lead">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Servers must be listed on the server browser, and must not use
            strict matchmaking.
          </li>
          <li>Servers should not be password protected.</li>
          <li>Servers must have VAC enabled.</li>
          <li>
            Servers must have a public, non-SDR (<a
              href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/multiplayer/steamdatagramrelay"
              target="_blank">Steam Datagram Relay</a
            >) IP, i.e. do not use the <code>-enablefakeip</code> launch param. This
            is so your server has an identifiable IP.
          </li>
          <li>
            Servers must respond to A2S queries in a reasonable amount of time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Servers must be running on a dedicated server (srcds, not a listen
            server).
          </li>
          <li>The server must at least have a max player cap of 18.</li>
          <li>The server must be running any active casual rotation map.</li>
          <li>
            The server must not have the following tags: <code
              >friendlyfire, highlander, trade, noquickplay, hidden</code
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Servers must not actively trick players or lie to them or make it
            difficult for them to find what they are looking for. Servers must
            report accurate information about itself to the Steam infrastructure
            and to clients.
          </li>
          <li>
            All of the information in the server browser must be accurate:
            number of players, number of bots, map, ping, region, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bots must be easily identified by players as bots. Do not give a bot
            an avatar or assign it a ping value.
          </li>
          <li>
            Servers cannot name themselves according to the naming conventions
            used by Valve, or any other server organization.
          </li>
          <li>
            Servers must not be malicious, by exposing clients to malware or
            spyware, or by bypassing <code>cl_disablehtmlmotd</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The engine uses tags to communicate to clients that certain
            modifications are in effect. Servers must use these tags properly.
            If a server makes these modifications using built-in engine
            functionality, they will be set automatically, and all a server
            needs to do is make sure they don't actively block them from
            working. However, if the server uses a plugin to make gameplay
            modifications with very similar effects, it is THEIR responsibility
            to ensure that the tags are set. Players do not care how the
            gameplay modification was implemented, they just want to know
            whether it is active or not.
          </li>
          <li>
            Here are some examples of tags that must be set accurately:
            <code
              >friendlyfire, respawntimes, norespawntime, increased_maxplayers,
              nocrits, dmgspread, highlander, gravity, mvm</code
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            No opening a MOTD window (hidden or visible) that is not requested
          </li>
          <li>No forcing clients to view the MOTD until a timer has expired</li>
          <li>No browser popups</li>
          <li>No giving or selling gameplay advantage to players</li>
          <li>No kicking players to make room for reserved slots</li>
          <li>No modifying stock maps, models, or materials</li>
          <li>
            No running non-default game modes: prop hunt, dodgeball, class wars,
            randomizer, engineer fortress, etc
          </li>
          <li>
            No running non-default addons like custom weapons, x10, all crits,
            etc
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p class="lead">

            devalue players' items, or interfering with the TF2 economy. This
            was enforced in the old Quickplay system.
          </li>
          <li>
            You must advertise your game name as "Team Fortress", the default.
            This was enforced in the old Quickplay system.

            to A2S through a proxy, but all responses must not be cached and be
            traceable directly to the game server per request. Anycast solutions
            which improve client routing and reduce ping are commendable, but
            players must be able to see an accurate ping in the server browser
            to the actual game server.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your <code>sv_region</code> must either be the default 255 or be accurate

        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2 class="display-6 fw-bold">You said there was a map requirement?</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Yes, if your server is running a map which is not in the active casual
        rotation, then players will not be directed to your server through
        quickplay. It's fine to switch to a custom map afterwards, and players
        can stay on your server in this case, or they can choose to leave. Once
        you switch back to an active casual map, players will be directed to
        your server again. Work and investigation is ongoing in this area for
        custom maps.
      </p>
      <h2 class="display-6 fw-bold">What's the active casual map rotation?</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Any map that is listed in the Casual matchmaking group will be eligible
        for quickplay. This updates dynamically, so holiday maps like for Scream
        Fortress and Smissmas will only be active during the holiday.
        <br /><br />
        There are a few exceptions for holiday maps which do not contain any holiday
        gimmicks. These are: ctf_doublecross_snowy, ctf_haarp, ctf_frosty, ctf_snowfall_final,
        ctf_turbine_winter, cp_frostwatch, pl_frostcliff, pl_chilly, pl_coal_event,
        pl_rumford_event, pl_wutville_event, plr_hacksaw, koth_maple_ridge_event,
        koth_megalo, koth_snowtower, pd_snowville_event, pd_galleria.
        <br /><br />
        There's also a few community maps allowed. Right now these are ones which
        are release candidate or later, and have a variant already accepted into
        the game, i.e. a holiday version. These are: cp_stoneyridge_rc2, cp_ambush_rc5,
        pl_coal_rc23, pl_fifthcurve_rc1, pl_millstone_v4, pl_rumford_rc2, pl_rumble_rc1,
        pl_sludgepit_final4, pl_vineyard_rc8b, koth_bagel_rc9b, koth_brine_rc3a,
        koth_maple_ridge_rc2, koth_megasnow_rc1, koth_moonshine, koth_slaughter_rc1,
        koth_synthetic_rc6a, koth_undergrove_rc1.
        <br /><br />
        You may be asking why there are exceptions. There are some regions where
        being strict on maps would completely obliterate the server pool due to low
        server population. Players can also ban maps of their choosing, so keep in
        mind that it's probably best to avoid some of these holiday/custom maps even
        if they are allowed by the quickplay system.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Note:</strong> We're also currently experimenting with being looser
        with these restrictions, and allowing even more community maps, so that quickplay
        users aren't excluded from important parts of the server population, especially
        in regions where servers are hard to come by. This is an area of active investigation
        and we're gathering feedback from both server owners and players regarding
        this. The allowed maplist thus is in active flux and there are maps allowed
        in quickplay which may not be listed on this FAQ yet. The current criteria
        for this is mostly a mix of player playtime and regional server availability.
      </p>
      <h2 class="display-6 fw-bold">
        Are there restrictions to the Any game mode search type?
      </h2>
      <p class="lead">
        We exclude some gamemodes in the Any game mode (Random) search type. If
        you want your server to be available for this search queue, you cannot
        run the following gamemodes: Arena, Robot Destruction, Passtime,
        Mannpower, VS Saxton Hale, Zombie Infection or Medieval Mode.
      </p>
      <h2 class="display-6 fw-bold">How do you get this data?</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        We use the public server browser list and server query information. If
        you're open to players from the public, quickplay will evaluate your
        eligibility and send players your way.
      </p>
      <h2 class="display-6 fw-bold">How does reputation actually work?</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Right now, reputation is not implemented. There is no server that is
        preferred or unpreferred over others, besides from players and ping. The
        plan is to implement reputation as a monitoring system for player
        satisfaction, and ideas are welcome for anything that you think could
        work!
      </p>
      <h2 class="display-6 fw-bold">Are floating IPs ok?</h2>
      <p class="lead">Yes.</p>
      <h2 class="display-6 fw-bold">How can I opt-out?</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        We provide a few ways to opt-out. Some are explicit, like the
        noquickplay tag (which you can set using <code
          >tf_server_identity_disable_quickplay 1</code
        >), or the hidden tag (which removes you from public server lists, can
        be set using <code>hide_server 1</code> or <code>tf_mm_strict 2</code>).
        <br />
        There's also some implicit ways. If you run a server which isn't eligible
        for quickplay, like a surf, jump, or other custom gamemode server, obviously
        you don't have to worry about opting out.
      </p>
