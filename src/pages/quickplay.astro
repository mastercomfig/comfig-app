        Hi, thanks for trying out quickplay! You may have a few questions about
        it, which should be answered down below. Thanks, and have fun!<br /><br
        />And if you're a community server host, check out our <a
          href="/quickplay/host_faq">Server Hoster FAQ</a
        > for more information about quickplay requirements and how we can work together
        to make a great experience for players.
      </p>

      <h2 class="display-6 fw-bold">What is this?</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        This is a best attempt at recreating the old in-game Quickplay feature
        as accurately as possible, and updating it to work in the current times
        and in browser. It is merely an experimental proof of concept now, but
        will continue to improve over the coming weeks!
      </p>

      <h2 class="display-6 fw-bold">How do I report a problem?</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Join us <a href="https://discord.gg/comfig">on Discord</a> and report your
        issues to the <span class="text-bg-primary p-1 mx-1"
          >#tf2-quickplay</span
        > channel, or use the emails listed out in the other answers below. We welcome
        feedback from both players and server owners!
      </p>

      <h2 class="display-6 fw-bold">How do I share this around?</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        We really appreciate the enthuasiasm! The more people use quickplay, the
        better it'll be! You can share our easy to remember <strong
          >quickplay.tf</strong
        > link, and even include it in your Steam name!
      </p>

      <h2 class="display-6 fw-bold">How does this work?</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Servers which are selected for the quickplay pool are then searched
        through according to your preferences. You get matched into the server
        with the best score. Servers are scored according to player counts and
        estimated ping/region to be ideal for the player searching, as well as a
        reputation bonus.
      </p>

      <h2 class="display-6 fw-bold">
        Why did I get matched into an empty server?
      </h2>
      <p class="lead">
        When you get matched into an empty server, it usually means there's no
        good options available for your region. If you want to get into a
        populated match as soon as possible, try adjusting your filters or your
        gamemode selection.
        <br />
        <br />
        However, if you are patient, other quickplay players from your region will
        most likely also get matched into your server, and this will start a healthy
        chain reaction to sustain the server for a long time. Ideally, this takes
        around a minute or two if there are people searching in your region, but
        may take longer otherwise.
        <br />
        <br />
        At certain times, you may want to turn off "Strict regional matchmaking"
        so you can queue into other regions with players, if you're queuing at a
        time where your own region doesn't typically have players.
        <br />
        <br />
        Another tip: certain gamemodes may tend to be mostly instant respawn, so
        try expanding your filters that way.
        <br />
        <br />
        This isn't all to say we don't want to improve things! Please give us feedback
        if you've encountered an empty server at <a
          href="mailto:quickplaymatches@mastercomfig.com"
          >quickplaymatches@mastercomfig.com</a
        >. Let us know your general region, your search settings, and the time
        you searched for a game.
      </p>

      <h2 class="display-6 fw-bold">
        Why did I get matched into a full server?
      </h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Though we do track when servers get too full, it isn't perfect. You're
        basically competing with other players to join a server, and some
        servers which are getting a lot of traffic directed to it can have their
        player numbers spike up suddenly, and fill up the server. We want to
        always avoid these cases. Please give us feedback if you've encountered
        joining a full server at <a
          href="mailto:quickplaymatches@mastercomfig.com"
          >quickplaymatches@mastercomfig.com</a

        This could be for several reasons. One is a similar reason to above,
        where quickplay is trying to get you into a server with players, and
        servers in your region don't have them. However, it could also be a bug
        with how we calculate ping. So let us know at <a
          href="mailto:quickplayping@mastercomfig.com"
          >quickplayping@mastercomfig.com</a
        >. Give your general region, your search settings, the time you search
        for a game, and the server IP that you ended up on.
      </p>

      <h2 class="display-6 fw-bold">Does quickplay well in X region?</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Probably! There's a strong server offering in Europe, the Americas,
        Asia, and Oceania. Regions which don't have much or any servers
        available are Africa, India and the Middle East. Player counts in every
        region can vary depending on the time and day, of course, but there
        should be enough people in each populated region to use quickplay
        effectively.

      <h2 class="display-6 fw-bold">
        What's the point of this over other solutions?
      </h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Many people have been asking for a solution which behaves like the old
        quickplay. This is an exact replica of that system, adjusted to be more
        ideal for the current era of TF2. Other solutions like the server
        browser just aren't an easy, one click and curated solution for having
        the best chance of finding a casual-like server to play on.
      </p>

      <h2 class="display-6 fw-bold">What servers are eligible?</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        We take the entire public server list into account, and filter it based
        upon our requirements. Servers must generally follow default TF2
        gameplay rules (excluding a few preference-based exceptions), without
        adverse modifications which players looking for an unmodified casual
        experience do not want. These server modifications are not allowed for
        servers in quickplay. You can learn more about detailed requirements in
        the <a href="/quickplay/host_faq">server hoster FAQ</a>.
      </p>

      <h2 class="display-6 fw-bold">
        I found a server which breaks the rules on Quickplay.

        Give us the server IP, name and evidence at <a
          href="mailto:quickplayreports@mastercomfig.com"
          >quickplayreports@mastercomfig.com</a
        >.
      </p>

      <h2 class="display-6 fw-bold">What is reputation?</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Reputation is a matchmaking metric given to servers if players are shown
        to enjoy them. It is a small part of the overall scoring system used to
        match servers with players. It is currently not implemented.

      <h2 class="display-6 fw-bold">How do I support you and this project?</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Thanks for the offer! This project takes a lot of time, effort and
        money. It'd be much appreciated if you checked out <a
          href="https://docs.comfig.app/page/support_me/"
          >the ways to support me</a
        >, but feedback and thanks also helps a lot too :).
